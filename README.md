This is my final semester project for the Computer Programming 1 major subject. This project is a simple library management system. The project is implemented in C++ and uses the Vector Standard Template Library to store data elements using a dynamic arrays. The project is already done, but I am willing to get a feedback for changes and updates on features to improve it in the future.


## Installation

To use this project, you will need to print first the list of all books, to know what books are available. You can run the project by opening the .cpp file in Visual Studio or any other compilers and running the project. 

The libraries used in this project does not require any installation.


## How to use the project

The project will ask you to enter your choice on the list that are printed. After that, you can either view the list of books, borrow a book, return a book or exit the program. 

The main output will be printed in the console. You can choose to add a new book or exit the program. If you choose to add a new book, you will be asked to enter the name and the quantity of the book. After that, the book will be added to books list. 

You can choose to search books by prefix, or exit the program. If you choose to search books by prefix, you will be asked to enter the prefix of the book. After that, the book you are searching will be printed in the console. 

You can choose to borrow a book or exit the program. If you choose to borrow a book, you will be asked to enter your name and the name of the book you want to borrow. After that, the book will be removed from the book quantity list and your name will be added to the borrowed books list. 

You can choose to return a book or exit the program. If you choose to return a book, you will be asked to enter your name and the name of the book you want to return. After that, your name and the book will be removed from the borrowed books list and added to the books list. 

You can choose to view the list of borrowed books, list of all books, and list of all returned books. If you choose to view one of them, the list will be printed in the console.
